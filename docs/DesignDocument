Mukt Design Document


Questions to go over:

1.  How will the program run?
  a. Will a config file of some sort be parsed before hand?
    i. If so, what type of options will be passed as parameters?

2. Plugin loading.
  a. Should we write something of a module loader? We can get the return of
functions passed along as function pointers, as the functions manipulate
the backend.

3. Arguments passed to the editor:
  example:
    mukt foo.txt                              # this will open up foo.txt
    mukt -C=customConfigFilepath.conf foo.txt # This will open up foo.txt with
                                              # the configuration from the
                                              # filepath.

  Whats your thoughts on this?

4. Types of options we will be implementing and how to go about them.
